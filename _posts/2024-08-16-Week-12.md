## Finished

### Implemented Evaluation data service

- Basic CRUD operations (`Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`).
- Used JSON-format file storage, following the schema from [last week](https://zhongheng-cheng.github.io/2024/08/09/Week-11.html#contemplating-evaluation-system).
- Created tests for every operation.
- Integrated evaluation window and rankings/notes inputting into the workflow.
    - Ranking 0-10 for evaluation matrix
    - Text input for additional notes

### Finished The Whole Workflow

Here is the whole workflow demo video.

## Other Messages From The Weekly Meeting

- Consider **containerizing** the frame blender system for better portability.
- Two main work to make the system doing more _frame blending_ work instead of _frame combination_ or something else.

## To-do List For Next Week

- Create a file in home directory on case HPC with detailed commands for running the frame blender system.
- Prepare for the final evaluation by ensuring all required information (e.g., code URL) is ready for submission to Google.

### Commands used to enter Frame Blender

```bash
# Entering Gallina home where all the codes and data are stored
# Evaluation data is store as `evaluation.json` at `./data/evaluation.json`
cd /mnt/rds/redhen/gallina/home/zxc808/gsoc2024-frame-blending

# Entering automated shell scripts' directory
cd shell_scripts

# Check repository update from git and copy `data/` to tmp work space in scratch/
./create_workspace.sh

# Request GPU node
./request_node.sh

# When allocated resource and entered bash environment in GPU node, 
# you should be already at the tmp workspace, which is /scratch/users/zxc808/gsoc2024-frame-blending
# Run Frame Blender
./frame_blender --encoding=ascii
```

### Key bindings in Frame Blender

When in Frame Blender interface:

- `Esc`: Quit
- `Tab`: Move to next window
- `+`/`-`: Add/Remove input window
- In **Settings window**:
    - `Arrow keys`: Switch settings and change setting
- In **Input window**:
    - Enter characters in Input windows and get search result automatically in Hierarchy window when available
    - `Enter`: Enter Hierarchy window
    - `Backspace`: Cancel confirmed frame
- In **Hierarchy window**:
    - `Backspace`: Quit Hierarchy window
    - `Arrow keys`: Switch different frames/frame relations
    - `Enter`: Confirm word
- When needed frames are all confirmed:
    - `/`: Start generating result
    - `Tab`: Switch to Evaluation window
    - `Arrow keys`/`Text input`: Enter evaluation
    - `Enter`: Submit evaluation form (stored to `/data/evaluation.json`)

### Updating the data to Gallina home

After submitting the evaluation form, the data has been stored in `evaluation.json` file in tmp workspace.
We will need to update the file to Gallina home:
- Press `Esc` to quit Frame Blender
- Use `exit` to exit GPU node
- Under the `shell_scripts`, use:
```bash
./update_gallina_home.sh
```
