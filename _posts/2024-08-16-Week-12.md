## Other Messages From The Weekly Meeting

- Consider **containerizing** the frame blender system for better portability.
- Two main work to make the system doing more _frame blending_ work instead of _frame combination_ or something else.

## To-do List For Next Week

- Create a file in home directory on case HPC with detailed commands for running the frame blender system.
- Prepare for the final evaluation by ensuring all required information (e.g., code URL) is ready for submission to Google.
